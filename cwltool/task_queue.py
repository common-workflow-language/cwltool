    """A TaskQueue class.

    Uses a first-in, first-out queue of tasks executed on a fixed number of
    threads.

    New tasks enter the queue and are started in the order received,
    as worker threads become available.

    If thread_count == 0 then tasks will be synchronously executed
    when add() is called (this makes the actual task queue behavior a
    no-op, but may be a useful configuration knob).

    The thread_count is also used as the maximum size of the queue.

    The threads are created during TaskQueue initialization.  Call
    join() when you're done with the TaskQueue and want the threads to
    stop.
