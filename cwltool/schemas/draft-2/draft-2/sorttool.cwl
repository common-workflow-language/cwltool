    # Example command line program wrapper for the Unix tool "sort"
    # demonstrating command line flags.
    class: CommandLineTool
    description: "Sort lines using the `sort` command"

    # This example is similar to the previous one, with an additional input
    # parameter called "reverse".  It is a boolean parameter, which is
    # intepreted as a command line flag.  The value of "prefix" is used for
    # flag to put on the command line if "reverse" is true, if "reverse" is
    # false, no flag is added.
    #
    # This example also introduced the "position" field.  This indicates the
    # sorting order of items on the command line.  Lower numbers are placed
    # before higher numbers.  Here, the "--reverse" flag (if present) will be
    # added to the command line before the input file path.
    inputs:
      - id: "#reverse"
        type: boolean
        inputBinding:
          position: 1
          prefix: "--reverse"
      - id: "#input"
        type: File
        inputBinding:
          position: 2

    outputs:
      - id: "#output"
        type: File
        outputBinding:
          glob: output.txt

    baseCommand: sort
    stdout: output.txt
