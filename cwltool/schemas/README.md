Common Workflow Language
========================

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an informal, multi-vendor working group
consisting of various organizations and individuals that have an interest in
portability of data analysis workflows.  Our goal is to create specifications
that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are
powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.

CWL builds on technologies such as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) and
[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) for data modeling and
[Docker](http://docker.com) for portable runtime environments.

CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as
Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.

## CWL User Guide

[User guide for the current stable specification (draft-3)](http://www.commonwl.org/draft-3/UserGuide.html),
provides a gentle introduction to writing CWL command line tool and workflow descriptions.

## CWL Specification

The current stable specification is [v1.0](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/):

http://www.commonwl.org/draft-v1.0/

Older drafts: [draft-1](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/tree/master/draft-1), [draft-2](http://www.commonwl.org/draft-2/), [draft-3](http://www.commonwl.org/draft-3/)

There is a Jenkins server maintained by Curoverse that runs tests for the
reference implementation, builds and uploads packages, and builds and uploads
Docker images:
