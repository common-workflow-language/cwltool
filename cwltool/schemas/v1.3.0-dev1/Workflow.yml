      # Abstract

      This specification defines the Common Workflow Language (CWL)
      Workflow description, a vendor-neutral standard for representing
      analysis tasks where a sequence of operations are described
      using a directed graph of operations to transform input to
      output.  CWL is portable across a variety of computing
      platforms.

      ## Introduction to CWL Workflow standard v1.3.0-dev1

      This specification represents the latest development version from the
      CWL group.

      ## Changelog
      See also the [CWL Command Line Tool Description, v1.3.0-dev1 changelog](CommandLineTool.html#Changelog).
      For other changes since CWL v1.0, see the
      [CWL Workflow Description, v1.1 changelog](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.1/Workflow.html#Changelog)
      and
      [CWL Workflow Description, v1.2 changelog](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html#Changelog)

      ## Purpose

      The Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description
      express workflows for data-intensive science, such as
      bioinformatics, physics, astronomy, geoscience, and machine
      learning.  This specification is intended to define a data and
      execution model for Workflows that can be implemented on top of
      a variety of computing platforms, ranging from an individual
      workstation to cluster, grid, cloud, and high performance
      computing systems. Details related to execution of these
      workflow not laid out in this specification are open to
      interpretation by the computing platform implementing this
      specification.

- type: record
  name: WorkflowStepInput
  extends: [Identified, InputSink, LoadContents, Labeled]
  docParent: "#AbstractWorkflowStep"
  doc: |
    The input of a workflow step connects an upstream parameter (from the
    workflow inputs, or the outputs of other workflows steps) with the input
    parameters of the process specified by the `run` field. Only input parameters
    declared by the target process will be passed through at runtime to the process
    though additional parameters may be specified (for use within `valueFrom`
    expressions for instance) - unconnected or unused parameters do not represent an
    error condition.

    # Input object

    A WorkflowStepInput object must contain an `id` field in the form
    `#fieldname` or `#prefix/fieldname`.  When the `id` field contains a slash
    `/` the field name consists of the characters following the final slash
    (the prefix portion may contain one or more slashes to indicate scope).
    This defines a field of the workflow step input object with the value of
    the `source` parameter(s).

    # Merging multiple inbound data links

    To merge multiple inbound data links,
    [MultipleInputFeatureRequirement](#MultipleInputFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    If the sink parameter is an array, or named in a [workflow
    scatter](#ScatterWorkflowStep) operation, there may be multiple inbound
    data links listed in the `source` field.  The values from the
    input links are merged depending on the method specified in the
    `linkMerge` field.  If both `linkMerge` and `pickValue` are null
    or not specified, and there is more than one element in the
    `source` array, the default method is "merge_nested".

    If both `linkMerge` and `pickValue` are null or not specified, and
    there is only a single element in the `source`, then the input
    parameter takes the scalar value from the single input link (it is
    *not* wrapped in a single-list).

    * **merge_nested**

      The input must be an array consisting of exactly one entry for each
      input link.  If "merge_nested" is specified with a single link, the value
      from the link must be wrapped in a single-item list.

    * **merge_flattened**

      1. The source and sink parameters must be compatible types, or the source
         type must be compatible with single element from the "items" type of
         the destination array parameter.
      2. Source parameters which are arrays are concatenated.
         Source parameters which are single element types are appended as
         single elements.

    # Picking non-null values among inbound data links

    If present, `pickValue` specifies how to pick non-null values among inbound data links.

    `pickValue` is evaluated
      1. Once all source values from upstream step or parameters are available.
      2. After `linkMerge`.
      3. Before `scatter` or `valueFrom`.

    This is specifically intended to be useful in combination with
    [conditional execution](#AbstractWorkflowStep), where several upstream
    steps may be connected to a single input (`source` is a list), and
    skipped steps produce null values.

    Static type checkers should check for type consistency after inferring what the type
    will be after `pickValue` is applied, just as they do currently for `linkMerge`.

    * **first_non_null**

      For the first level of a list input, pick the first non-null element.  The result is a scalar.
      It is an error if there is no non-null element.  Examples:
      * `[null, x, null, y] -> x`
      * `[null, [null], null, y] -> [null]`
      * `[null, null, null] -> Runtime Error`

      *Intended use case*: If-else pattern where the
      value comes either from a conditional step or from a default or
      fallback value. The conditional step(s) should be placed first in
      the list.

    * **the_only_non_null**

      For the first level of a list input, pick the single non-null element.  The result is a scalar.
      It is an error if there is more than one non-null element.  Examples:

      * `[null, x, null] -> x`
      * `[null, x, null, y] -> Runtime Error`
      * `[null, [null], null] -> [null]`
      * `[null, null, null] -> Runtime Error`

      *Intended use case*: Switch type patterns where developer considers
      more than one active code path as a workflow error
      (possibly indicating an error in writing `when` condition expressions).

    * **all_non_null**

      For the first level of a list input, pick all non-null values.
      The result is a list, which may be empty.  Examples:

      * `[null, x, null] -> [x]`
      * `[x, null, y] -> [x, y]`
      * `[null, [x], [null]] -> [[x], [null]]`
      * `[null, null, null] -> []`

      *Intended use case*: It is valid to have more than one source, but
       sources are conditional, so null sources (from skipped steps)
       should be filtered out.

        parameter **is** specified in this workflow step's `scatter` field.

        The value of `inputs` in the parameter reference or expression must be
        the input object to the workflow step after assigning the `source`
        values, applying `default`, and then scattering.  The order of
        evaluating `valueFrom` among step input parameters is undefined and the

    A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
    underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool` or another
    `Workflow`) in the `run` field and connects the input and output parameters
    of the underlying process to workflow parameters.

    # Conditional execution (Optional)

    Conditional execution makes execution of a step conditional on an
    expression.  A step that is not executed is "skipped".  A skipped
    step produces `null` for all output parameters.

    The `when` field controls conditional execution.  This is an
    expression that must be evaluated with `inputs` bound to the step
    input object (or individual scatter job), and returns a boolean
    value.  It is an error if this expression returns a value other
    than `true` or `false`.

    Conditional execution in CWL is an optional feature and is not required
    to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents. An implementation that
    does not support conditional executions must return a fatal error when
    attempting to execute a workflow that uses conditional constructs the
    implementation does not support.

    # Subworkflows

    To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
    [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
    specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    It is a fatal error if a workflow directly or indirectly invokes itself as
    a subworkflow (recursive workflows are not allowed).

    To use scatter/gather,
    [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
    in the workflow or workflow step requirements.

    A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
    subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
    job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
    concurrently.

    The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
    scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
    type of each input parameter implicitly becomes an array of items of the
    input parameter type.  If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes
    a nested array.  As a result, upstream parameters which are connected to
    scattered parameters must be arrays.

    All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
    in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.

    If any scattered parameter runtime value is an empty array, all outputs are
    set to empty arrays and no work is done for the step, according to
    applicable scattering rules.

    If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
    describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.

      * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
          element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
          if all input arrays are not the same length.

      * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

      * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
          producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
          output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
          order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.

    # Conditional execution (Optional)

    The condition is evaluated after `scatter`, using the input object
    of each individual scatter job.  This means over a set of scatter
    jobs, some may be executed and some may be skipped.  When the
    results are gathered, skipped steps must be `null` in the output
    arrays.

    # Iterative execution (Optional)

    The `loop` field controls iterative execution. It defines the input
    parameters of the loop iterations after the first one (inputs of the
    first iteration are the step input parameters, as usual). If no
    `loop` rule is specified for a given step `in` field, the initial
    value is kept constant among all iterations.

    When a `loop` field is present, the `when` field is mandatory. It is
    evaluated before each loop iteration and acts as a termination condition:
    as soon as the `when` expression evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates
    and the step outputs are propagated to the subsequent workflow steps.

    The `outputMethod` field describes how to deal with loop outputs after
    termination:

      * **last** specifies that only the last computed element for each output
        parameter should be propagated to the subsequent steps. This is the
        default value.

      * **all** specifies that an array with all output values computed at the
        end of each loop iteration should be propagated to the subsequent steps.
        Elements in the array must be ordered according to the loop iterations
        that produced them.

    Iterative execution in CWL is an optional feature and is not required
    to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents. An implementation that
    does not support iterative executions must return a fatal error when
    attempting to execute a workflow that uses iterative constructs the
    implementation does not support.

        is kept constant among all iterations.

        A skipped step produces a `null` on each output if the `outputMethod`
        is set to `last`, and an empty array if the `outputMethod` is set to `all`.

    A workflow describes a set of **steps** and the **dependencies** between
    those steps.  When a step produces output that will be consumed by a
    second step, the first step is a dependency of the second step.

    When there is a dependency, the workflow engine must execute the preceding
    step and wait for it to successfully produce output before executing the
    dependent step.  If two steps are defined in the workflow graph that
    are not directly or indirectly dependent, these steps are **independent**,
    and may execute in any order or execute concurrently.  A workflow is
    complete when all steps have been executed.

    Dependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source`
    field on [workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and
    `outputSource` field on [workflow output
    parameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).

    The `source` field on each workflow step input parameter expresses
    the data links that contribute to the value of the step input
    parameter (the "sink").  A workflow step can only begin execution
    when every data link connected to a step has been fulfilled.

    The `outputSource` field on each workflow step input parameter
    expresses the data links that contribute to the value of the
    workflow output parameter (the "sink").  Workflow execution cannot
    complete successfully until every data link connected to an output
    parameter has been fulfilled.

    ## Workflow success and failure

    A completed step must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or
    `permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a step
    execution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may
    choose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate
    immediately upon `permanentFailure`.

    * If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then
    the workflow status is `permanentFailure`.

    * If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps
    complete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is
    `temporaryFailure`.

    * If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the
    workflow status is `success`.
