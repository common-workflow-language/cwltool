  ## Identifier resolution

  The schema may designate one or more fields as identifier fields to identify
  specific objects.  Processing must resolve relative identifiers to absolute
  identifiers using the following rules:

    * If an identifier URI begins with `#` it is a current document
      fragment identifier.  It is resolved relative to the base URI by
      setting or replacing the fragment portion of the base URI.

    * If an identifier URI contains `#` in some other position it is a
      relative URI with fragment identifier.  It is resolved relative
      to the base URI by stripping the last path segment from the base
      URI and adding the identifier followed by the fragment.

    * If an identifier URI does not contain a scheme and does not
      contain `#` it is a parent relative fragment identifier.

    * If an identifier URI is a parent relative fragment identifier
      and the base URI does not contain a document fragment, set the
      document fragment on the base URI.

    * If an identifier URI is a parent relative fragment identifier
      and the object containing this identifier is assigned to a
      parent object field defined with `subscope` in
      `jsonldPredicate`, append a slash `/` to the base URI fragment
      followed by the value of the parent field `subscope`.  Then
      append the identifier as described in the next rule.

    * If an identifier URI is a parent relative fragment identifier
      and the base URI contains a document fragment, append a slash
      `/` to the fragment followed by the identifier field to the
      fragment portion of the base URI.

    * If an identifier URI begins with a namespace prefix declared in
      `$namespaces` followed by a colon `:`, the prefix and colon must be
      replaced by the namespace declared in `$namespaces`.

    * If an identifier URI is an absolute URI consisting of a scheme and path,
      no processing occurs.

  When preprocessing visits a node containing an identifier, that identifier
  must be used as the base URI to process child nodes.

  It is an error for more than one object in a document to have the same
  absolute URI.

  ### Identifier resolution example

  Given the following schema:

  ```
- $include: ident_res_schema.yml
- |
  ```

  Process the following example:

  ```
- $include: ident_res_src.yml
- |
  ```

  This becomes:

  ```
- $include: ident_res_proc.yml
- |
  ```
