  ## Domain Specific Language for secondary files

  Fields may be tagged `secondaryFilesDSL: true` in `jsonldPredicate`.  If so, the field is expanded using the
  following micro-DSL for secondary files:

  * If the value is a string, it is transformed to an object with two fields `pattern` and `required`
  * By default, the value of `required` is `null` (this indicates default behavior, which may be based on the context)
  * If the value ends with a question mark `?` the question mark is
    stripped off and the value of the field `required` is set to `False`
  * The remaining value is assigned to the field `pattern`

  ### Type DSL example

  Given the following schema:

  ```
- $include: sfdsl_res_schema.yml
- |
  ```

  Process the following example:

  ```
- $include: sfdsl_res_src.yml
- |
  ```

  This becomes:

  ```
- $include: sfdsl_res_proc.yml
- |
  ```
