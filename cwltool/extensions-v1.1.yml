    cudaVersionMin:
      type: string
      doc: |
        Minimum CUDA version to run the software, in X.Y format.  This
        corresponds to a CUDA SDK release.  When running directly on
        the host (not in a container) the host must have a compatible
        CUDA SDK (matching the exact version, or, starting with CUDA
        11.3, matching major version).  When run in a container, the
        container image should provide the CUDA runtime, and the host
        driver is injected into the container.  In this case, because
        CUDA drivers are backwards compatible, it is possible to
        use an older SDK with a newer driver across major versions.

        See https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/ for
        details.

        CUDA hardware capability required to run the software, in X.Y
        format.

        * If this is a single value, it defines only the minimum
          compute capability.  GPUs with higher capability are also
          accepted.

        * If it is an array value, then only select GPUs with compute
          capabilities that explicitly appear in the array.
    cudaDeviceCountMin:

      doc: |
        Minimum number of GPU devices to request.  If not specified,
        same as `cudaDeviceCountMax`.  If neither are specified,
        default 1.
    cudaDeviceCountMax:

      doc: |
        Maximum number of GPU devices to request.  If not specified,
        same as `cudaDeviceCountMin`.
